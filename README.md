# 🧮 Simple Calculator (Python OOP)

This is a basic calculator program written in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It supports four fundamental arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- square
- modules
- floor division

---

## 🚀 Features

- Class-based structure using `calculator`
- Takes user input for two numbers
- Separate methods for each operation
- Clean and readable output

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file named `calculator.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:


💡 Example

Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Result of division: 2.0


🌱 Future Improvements

- Add a menu for selecting operations interactively
- Allow continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit
- Validate inputs to avoid crashes with non-numeric entries
- Build a simple GUI using Tkinter
- Create a web version using Flask


🎓 This project is part of my Python OOP learning journey.
